## Professional Experience

### AXONS (CPF IT Center) | AI Developer (Senior / Team Lead)
**Bangkok, Thailand | 2023 – Present**

Transitioned to a Senior role focusing on Solution Architecture, AIOps, and Security, guiding junior developers in delivering production-grade systems.

**Key Achievements:**
- **GenAI Platform & API Strategy:** Architected a centralized LLM Platform using OpenWebUI frontend and Cloud Run backend (FastAPI + API Key Auth). Designed the system to support users without their own applications while providing APIs for other dev teams.
- **Automated Chatbot Pipeline:** Designed a "Zero-Code" ingestion pipeline where users upload documents to SharePoint (controlled via Excel), triggering automated OCR, Chunking, and Indexing into the Datastore.
- **Scalability & Efficiency:** Streamlined the development process, enabling the team to deploy production chatbots across 7 distinct business domains within one year.
- **Resource Optimization:** Reduced development effort from 4 developers/3 months per project to 1 developer/3 months by standardizing the framework.
- **Mentorship & Quality Control:** Led the design of MVPs/POCs and supervised junior developers in production implementation, specifically in prompt optimization and setting up LLM-as-a-Judge testing loops using real user Q&A data.

### Panasonic SPT | Electrical Engineer
**2020 – 2023**

- Managed PLC programming, maintenance, and process optimization for production lines
- Solved critical production issues under high-pressure environments, ensuring minimal downtime

### Belton | Maintenance Engineer
**2018 – 2020**

- Conducted preventive maintenance and root cause analysis for machinery and on-site operational systems

## Key Projects

### 1. MooD: When Pigs Get Sick (Research)
**arXiv:2503.15204 | Co-author & System Architect**

- **Focus:** Addressed misdiagnosis in livestock farming using a Multi-Agent System (MAS) and Mixture of Experts (MoE) approach
- **Solution:** Architected a LangGraph-based workflow involving specialized agents (Diagnostician, Critic) and a Dual-Store RAG (separating Disease vs. Drug data) on Vertex AI
- **Impact:** Achieved diagnostic accuracy equivalent to professional veterinarians (validated by CPF). Estimated ~100 Million THB/year business impact through disease prevention and mortality reduction

### 2. GenAI Platform – OpenWebUI & Multi-Modal RAG

- **Problem:** Business users needed AI access but lacked internal applications; existing tools failed to display source images from technical documents
- **Solution:** Built a platform using OpenWebUI as the frontend, connecting to a Cloud Run backend. Implemented Dynamic System Prompt Injection to allow flexible agent behavior without code changes
- **Key Innovation:** Developed "Source Image Retrieval" feature that returns actual images/diagrams from RAG documents directly in the chat preview (not AI-generated images), critical for technical manuals
- **Impact:** Democratized AI access for non-technical users and provided a robust, secure API layer for the organization

### 3. Corporate Chatbot Framework (Automated Pipeline)

- **Problem:** High demand for chatbots across multiple departments (HR, Legal, Farm) with limited development resources
- **Solution:** Engineered a Self-Service Pipeline where:
  - Users manage content via SharePoint & Excel
  - Automated scripts handle OCR and Vectorization
  - Junior devs focus solely on Prompt Optimization and Evaluation loops
- **Impact:** Successfully deployed 7 domain-specific chatbots in one year, reducing man-hours by ~75% while maintaining high accuracy through automated LLM-as-a-Judge testing

### 4. Shrimp Price Prediction System

- **Problem:** Procurement team relied on intuition for long-term planning, leading to suboptimal budget allocation
- **Solution:** Developed a LightGBM forecasting model integrating internal ERP data with external indicators (feed costs, weather, market indices)
- **Impact:** Deployed a PowerBI Dashboard with <10% MAPE (6-month horizon), enabling data-driven budgeting for the procurement team

### 5. PisitLaw (Side Project)

- **Type:** Legal AI / RAG
- **Focus:** AI Legal Assistant specialized in Thai Law
- **Specialty:** Handling Thai Government Documents (Royal Gazette), Thai Language NLP, Country-specific legal data
- **Tech:** RAG, Thai NLP, FastAPI, LangChain
